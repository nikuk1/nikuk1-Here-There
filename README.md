## Description
Here or There is a place where travelers can share the experiences they have had throughout the world. Upon visiting, the site, you are presented with most recent posts made, which each include a title, a photo, the name of the city visited, and the contents of the post. This is as far as you can go until you login. In order to signup, you will need to create a username, password, bio, city of residence, and add a profile avatar image. Once you have your own account, you can make your own posts as well as comment on others. 

## User Story
